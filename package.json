  "description": "This is a social sharing plugin that allows web developers to include social sharing buttons/links with just some basic configuration. Existing platforms such as bshare/baidushare/jiathis uses **HTTP** protocol to fetch resources which makes it very hard to deploy such services on **HTTPS** pages due to security restriction. This is what triggers this project. Currently it still supports limited number of platform, but I believe that it will be better through time : )",
